Certainly, here are instructions for TasK API to guide users on setting up and running the project and tests:

# Task Management API

This is a TypeScript project that provides a simple task management API. You can create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks. Tasks have attributes such as title, description, due date, category, and status.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:
````

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atdurai/task.git
cd task
```
````
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configuration (Optional)

If needed, modify the TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) and project settings to suit your requirements.

### 4. Run the Project

Start the task service by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Your server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or the port specified in the environment variables.

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /task` - Create a new task.
- `GET /task/:id` - Retrieve a task by its ID.
- `PUT /task/:id` - Update a specific task.
- `DELETE /task/:id` - Delete a specific task.
- `GET /tasks` - Retrieve all tasks.
- `GET /tasks?assignedTo=[username]` - Retrieve all tasks assigned to a specific user.
- `GET /tasks?category=[categoryName]` - Retrieve all tasks under a specific category.

## Testing

To run unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute your unit tests and provide test results and coverage information if you have a code coverage tool configured.

## External Serverless Service

There is also an external service running in serverless mode. You can find it in the following Git repository:

- [Serverless Git Repository](https://github.com/atdurai/task/tree/serverless)

```bash
git checkout serverless
```

Feel free to explore and enhance the project to meet your specific requirements.

```

This additional section provides information about the external service running in serverless mode and includes a link to the specific Git repository for that service.
